# ACCORDION FROM SCRATCH USING VANILLA SCRIPT

TASK: build an expandable element (much like a standard accordion) using HTML, CSS and Vanilla JavaScript (not jQuery!). We would like you to build it from scratch and make sure it is responsive. The title on the expandable element will be 'Terms and Conditions'. It will require some kind of arrow element to show to the user the element can be expanded. When the element is clicked by the user the element should expand to reveal some text which has previously been hidden. (For this text you can use Lorem Ipsum). When the Title is pressed again the element should close hiding the Lorem Ipsum text once again. This action must be repeatable as many times as the user presses the expandable title. The arrow element should rotate as the element is opened and closed indicating to the user an interaction has taken place. Also the whole thing should be accessible friendly. (This is very important!)

SOLUTION: I've prepared for you a solution which is served by Webpack. The whole environment contains basic Webpack configuration, basic styles, accordion component with functionality written in pure JavaScript. Everything in this package is prepared from scratch!
